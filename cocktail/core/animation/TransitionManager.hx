/**
 * The transition manager is in charge of starting
 * and stopping the transition of properties.
 * 
 * When at least one transition is in progress, the
 * TransitionManager setup delayed called to an
 * update method
 * 
 * The TransitionManager is a singleton and is in charge of
 * all the transitions in the Document
 * 
 * The data flow of a transition is as follow : 
	 * - the value of a transitionable property is updated
	 * - a pending animation is registered storing all the data needed to start
	 * a transition
	 * - when the next scheduled layout starts, the animator tries to start all registered
	 * pending animations
	 * - the animator checks if the property should be transitioned
	 * - if it does, starts a new transition using the TransitionManager
	 * - the TransitionManager schedule calls to its update callbacks while transitions
	 * are in progress, which triggers an invalidation mechanisms causing the document
	 * to be re-painted
	 * - While a transition is in progress, getting the computed value of the property return
	 * its current transitioning value
	 * - When the transition is complete, calls its complete callback, triggering invalidation
	 * and the dispatch of a transition end event on the transitioned element
