/**
 * The MouseEvent interface provides specific contextual information associated with Mouse events.
 *
 * The detail attribute inherited from UIEvent indicates the number of times a mouse button
 * has been pressed and released over the same screen location during a user action.
 * The attribute value is 1 when the user begins this action and increments by 1
 * for each full sequence of pressing and releasing. If the user moves the mouse
 * between the mousedown and mouseup the value will be set to 0, indicating
 * that no click is occurring.
 * 
 * TODO : implement
 * 
 * In the case of nested elements mouse events are always targeted at the most deeply
 * nested element. Ancestors of the targeted element may use bubbling to obtain
 * notification of mouse events which occur within its descendent elements.
