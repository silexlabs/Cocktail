/**
 * The EventListener interface is the primary way to handle events.

 * listener on an EventTarget.
 * 
 * The content authors should also
 * remove their EventListener from its EventTarget after they 
 * have completed using the listener.Copying a Node, with methods
 * such as Node.cloneNode or Range.cloneContents, must not copy
 * the event listeners attached to it.
 * 
 * Event listeners must
 * be attached to the newly created Node afterwards, if so desired.
 * 
 * Moving a Node, with methods Document.adoptNode, Node.appendChild,
 * or Range.extractContents, must not affect the event listeners attached to it.
