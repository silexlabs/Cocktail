 * The Event interface is used to provide contextual information

 * An object which implements the Event interface is generally
 * passed as the first parameter to an event handler. More specific
 * context information is passed to event handlers by deriving
 * additional interfaces from Event which contain information
 * directly relating to the type of event they accompany. These
 * derived interfaces are also implemented by the object passed
 * to the event listener.
 * 
 * TODO 2 : init methods such as initEvent have just been deprecated (2/07/2012),
 * should now refer to DOM4 spec for event construction
