	 * method, though it may be called multiple times during
	 * that phase if necessary. If called multiple times,
	 * the final invocation takes precedence.

	 * @param	canBubbleArg Specifies whether or not the event can bubble.
	 * @param	cancelableArg Specifies whether or not the event's default action can 
	 * be prevented. Since a TransitionEvent is purely for notification, there
	 * is no default action.
	 * @param	propertyNameArg Specifies the name of the property associated with
	 * the Event. (See the propertyName attribute.)
	 * @param	elapsedTimeArg Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, the transition has been
	 * running at the time of initialization. (See the elapsedTime attribute.)
	 * @param	pseudoElementArg Specifies the pseudo-element on which the
	 * transition occurred. (See the pseudoElement attribute.)
