/**
 * The Text interface inherits from CharacterData and represents the textual
 * content (termed character data in XML) of an Element or Attr. 
 * If there is no markup inside an element's content, the text is contained 
 * in a single object implementing the Text interface that is the only child of 
 * the element. If there is markup, it is parsed into the information items
 * (elements, comments, etc.) and Text nodes that form the list of children of
 * the element.
 * 
 * When a document is first made available via the DOM,
 * there is only one Text node for each block of text. Users may create
 * adjacent Text nodes that represent the contents of a given element
 * without any intervening markup, but should be aware that there is no way
 * to represent the separations between these nodes in XML or HTML, so they
 * will not (in general) persist between DOM editing sessions. 
 * The Node.normalize() method merges any such adjacent Text objects into a
 * single node for each block of text.
 * 
 * TODO 5 : implement normalize()
 * 
 * No lexical check is done on the content of a Text node and, depending
 * on its position in the document, some characters must be escaped 
 * during serialization using character references; e.g. the characters "<&" if
 * the textual content is part of an element or of an attribute, the character
 * sequence "]]>" when part of an element, the quotation mark character " or 
 * the apostrophe character ' when part of an attribute.
