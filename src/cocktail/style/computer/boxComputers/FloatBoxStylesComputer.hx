		//a block formatting context is computed as follows:If it only has inline-level children, the height is the distance
		//between the top of the topmost line box and the bottom of the bottommost line box. If it has block-level children, 
		//the height is the distance between the top margin-edge of the topmost block-level child box and the bottom margin-edge
		//of the bottommost block-level child box. Absolutely positioned children are ignored, and relatively positioned
		//boxes are considered without their offset. Note that the child box may be an anonymous block box. In addition,
		//if the element has any floating descendants whose bottom margin edge is below the element's bottom content edge,
		//then the height is increased to include those edges. Only floats that participate in this block formatting context
		//are taken into account, e.g., floats inside absolutely positioned descendants or other floats are not.

		//breaking lines other than where explicit line breaks occur, and also calculate the preferred minimum 
		//width, e.g., by trying all possible line breaks. CSS 2.1 does not define the exact algorithm. Thirdly,
		//find the available width: in this case, this is the width of the containing block minus the used values
		//of 'margin-left', 'border-left-width', 'padding-left', 'padding-right', 'border-right-width',
		//'margin-right', and the widths of any relevant scroll bars. Then the shrink-to-fit width is:
		//min(max(preferred minimum width, available width), preferred width).
