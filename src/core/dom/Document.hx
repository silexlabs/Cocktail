/**
 * The Document interface represents the entire HTML or XML document.
 * Conceptually, it is the root of the document tree, and provides the
 * primary access to the document's data. Since elements, text nodes,
 * comments, processing instructions, etc. cannot exist outside the
 * context of a Document, the Document interface also contains the
 * factory methods needed to create these objects. The Node objects 
 * created have a ownerDocument attribute which associates them with
 * the Document within whose context they were created. 
 * 
 * TODO : implement ownerDocument ?
