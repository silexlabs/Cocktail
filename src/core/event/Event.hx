/**
 * The Event interface is used to provide contextual information
 * about an event to the handler processing the event.
 * An object which implements the Event interface is generally
 * passed as the first parameter to an event handler. More specific
 * context information is passed to event handlers by deriving
 * additional interfaces from Event which contain information
 * directly relating to the type of event they accompany. These
 * derived interfaces are also implemented by the object passed
 * to the event listener.
