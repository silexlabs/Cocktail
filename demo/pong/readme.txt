Why did I do this?
- historically, the 1st game to be on TVs
- it should run on TVs: HBBTV and GoogleTV and AppleTV (I did not use any canvas/drawing)
- it should compile with NME (I did not use any text)
- it should work on phones in native and html5 versions (it have put transparent images on which you can click or tap to move the bat)
- it is very quick to do (I spent exactly 3 hours to do this and play with it a little bit)
- there are a lot of simple games like this (Iâ€™ll try a space invader next time)
