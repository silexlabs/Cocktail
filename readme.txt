== Cocktail, cross-platform haXe ==

Cocktail is a cross-platform library for the HaXe programming language. It bridges the gap between all the targets supported by haXe, removing inconsistencies behind a common API. With it, the same code base is used to deploy to these targets: Flash, javaScript, PHP

It helps multi device application development and should be used by haXe projects requiring cross-target compilation.

Silex Labs Cocktail library is released under GPL.
